#summary Tutorial on programming with gnizr using Eclipse and Maven

This document is intended for developers who want to extend gnizr capability or alter it's default application behavior. The build environment and setups described here are only a recommendation. Developers can choose to use other tools and build environment setups. 

= Introduction =

Gnizr is designed for developers to add new capabilities and alter the existing application behavior. The code base of gnizr is structured in a way that attempts to simplify many software engineering tasks. Through a "Hello World" example, this tutorial will give a walk-through of the gnizr code base structure and how developers can exploit this structure, using Eclipse and Maven, to rapidly prototype and implement an extended gnizr.
