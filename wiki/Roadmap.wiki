== How We Plan Releases ==

We usually plan releases with "soft" deadline. _Stable Releases_, softwares that are suitable for end-user deployment, are usually made available *every three months*. _Development Releases_, softwares with new features that are under active development, are usually released *every three weeks*. Our goal is to release gnizr software with small incremental changes as often as possible. 

The version number of Stable Release is in the form of `x.y.z`, where `x` and `y` are the major revision and the minor revision number, respectively. The number `z` is the bug-fix revision number. For example, if a software is labeled `2.2.0`, it means that it is the first Stable Release of gnizr software 2.2, and if it is labeled `2.2.3`, it means that it is the third bug-fix release of gnizr 2.2. 

The version number of Development Release is in the form of either `x.y.0-M#` or `x.y.0-RC#`. The string `M#` and `RC#` are the Milestone revision number and the Release Candidate revision number, respectively. For example, if a software is labeled `2.2.0-M4`, it means that it is the fourth milestone release of gnizr 2.2, and if it is labeled `2.2.0-RC1`, it means that it is the first Release Candidate of gnizr 2.2. When the software goes into RC, all API changes are prohibited and source code commits are limited to bug fixes. 

=== Branching ===

We create a new "Release Branch" when we begin developing the new version of the software (e.g., going from `2.2` to `2.3` and `2.5` to `3.0`). Release Branches are usually consisted of only major and minor version numbers (e.g., `gnizr-2.2`).  

=== Tagging ===

We tag our software after a Stable Release or a Development Release has been created. Tagged branches are usually consisted of major, minor and bugfix version number (e.g., `gnizr-2.2.0`). Sometimes they also include a build qualifier (e.g., `gnizr-2.2.0-M3`).
