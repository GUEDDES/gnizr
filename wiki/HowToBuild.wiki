This page describe the steps to build gnizr from SVN source code. Most users should download and install from [HowToInstall gnizr binary releases].

If you have any questions, send email to [http://groups.google.com/group/gnizr-users Gnizr User Discussion].

=== Required Tools ===

Our build configuration requires the following tools already been installed:

  * [http://maven.apache.org Apache Maven 2] (we use 2.0.7)
  * [http://www.javasoft.com Java SE Development Kit 6 (JDK 1.6)]
  
=== Download Source Code ===

Follow these [http://code.google.com/p/gnizr/source instructions].

Source code options:
  * `/trunk` -- the latest under active development; may not build or may fail tests.
  * `/branches` -- [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch04s04.html#svn-ch-4-sect-4.4.1 release branches]; software under "maintenance" mode; should build and pass tests.
  * `/tags` -- tagged Stable Releases and Development Releases; should build successfully and pass all tests.

=== Compile Source Code ===

Assume that you've checked out the source code in a top-level directory called `gnizr`.

  # Go to the top-level directory
    * `cd gnizr`
  # Install the root project POM and update Maven plugins
    * `mvn -U -N install`
  # Compile gnizr modules, run JUnit tests and assemble the application
    * `mvn package assembly:assembly`  
  # If you see no error messages, then the build is complete.
    * `cd gnizr/target`

In the `target` directory, you will find two different outputs of the same build: one in a uncompressed directory structure, and the other bundled in a ZIP file. 

=== Problems & Issues ===
