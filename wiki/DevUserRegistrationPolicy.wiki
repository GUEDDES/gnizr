= Introduction =

Gnizr implements a policy-driven user registration function. Depending on the configuration, system administrators can choose to implement one of the following user registration policy:

  # Allow any one with a valid email address to create and activate new user accounts.
  # Allow any one to create new accounts, but their activation requires the explicit approval from the administrator.
  # Prohibit any one to create new account, and only the administrator can create and activate new user accounts.
