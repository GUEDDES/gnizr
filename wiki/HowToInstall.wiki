  * Apache Tomcat 5.x
  * MySQL 5.0+

  # Prepare MySQL database for gnizr installation
    * See SetupGnizrDatabase
  # Copy gnizr web application directory to Tomcat
    * `cp -r gnizr-x.y.z/gnizr /your/tomcat/webapps/`
  # Edit gnizr configuration

  # Start Tomcat

== Steps to Upgrade ==

  # Download and unpack latest gnizr release.
    * e.g., after unpacking, the top-level directory is `gnizr-x.y.z`

  # Backup your existing gnizr web application in Tomcat

== Login and Create New Accounts ==

Gnizr comes with a default user account -- `gnizr`, who is the administrator of the system. After you have logged in as `gnizr`, you can create additional user accounts.

  # Go to the front page of gnizr 
     * If installed on `localhost` port 8080, `http://localhost:8080/gnizr`
  # Log in as `gnizr`
     * username: `gnizr`
     * password: `gnizr` 
  # Change `gnizr` password (*IMPORTANT!*) 
     * Go to `settings` -> `Change your password`
  # Create new accounts 
     * Go to `settings` -> `Manage user accounts`
