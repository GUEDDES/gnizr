#summary Prepare MySQL database for gnizr installation
#labels Phase-Deploy

This page describes the steps to prepare MySQL database for gnizr installation. These steps must be performed before running the gnizr web application.

== Requirement ==

  # Install MySQL 5.0
  # Create a database schema for gnizr
    * e.g., `gnizr_db` 
  # Create a database account for gnizr, and make sure this account has all the necessary privileges to manage and access the gnizr database schema
    * e.g., username: `gnizr`, password: `gnizrpass`   
  # Download and unpack a gnizr release

Note: We assume that you have properly installed MySQL database. If you need addition help on using MySQL, see http://dev.mysql.com

== Create database tables and stored procedures ==

  # Go to the SQL script directory
    * `cd gnizr-x.y.z/sql`
  # Run BASH script to setup database
    * `chmod 755 loadsch.sh loadsp.sh`
    * `./loadsch.sh gnizr_db gnizr gnizrpass` 
    * syntax: `loadsch [db_name] [db_username] [db_password]`
  # Done!


== Upgrade database tables and stored procedures ==

Instructions described in this section are for upgrading gnizr software from an existing installation. If you install gnizr for the first time, follow instructions in "_Create database tables and stored procedures_". 

=== Upgrading to gnizr 2.3.0  ===

If you are currently running gnizr 2.2.x or 2.3.0 milestones, do the following:

  # *Backup your existing database* -- always a good idea :-)
  # Go to the SQL script directory
    * `cd gnizr-2.3.0/sql`
  # Run BASH script to upgrade database 
    * `chmod 755 loadsch.sh loadsp.sh loadupg.sh`
    * syntax: `loadupg [db_name] [db_username] [db_password]`
        * e.g., `./loadupg.sh gnizr_db gnizr gnizrpass`
  # Done!
