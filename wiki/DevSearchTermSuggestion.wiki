= Introduction =

The purpose of search term suggestion is to improve the user's search experience. This feature can help to overcome the following problems:

  * Often a user doesn't know whether or not an input search query will return any matching results until the user actually clicks on the 'search' button. A trial-and-error approach to search is inefficient. 
  * Searching bookmarks by tags requires prior knowledge about tag usage. Users cannot possibly remember all available tags used in the system. If a user doesn't know what tags exist in the system, the user can't use tags to search for bookmarks effectively. 
  * Machine tag syntax can be difficult to remember for some users. Not knowing what values are available for a given machine tag predicate, users can't effectively search for machine tagged bookmarks.
