#labels Phase-Deploy

This page describes the steps to prepare MySQL database for gnizr installation. These steps must be performed before running the gnizr web application. 

== Requirement ==

  # Install MySQL 5.0+
  # Create a database schema for gnizr
    * e.g., `gnizr_db` 
  # Create a database account for gnizr, and make sure this account has all the necessary privileges to manage and access the gnizr database schema
    * e.g., username: `gnizr`, password: `gnizrpass`   
  # Download and unpack a gnizr release

Note: We assume that you have properly installed MySQL database. If you need addition help on using MySQL, see http://dev.mysql.com

== Create database tables and stored procedures ==

  # Go to the SQL script directory
    * `cd gnizr-x.y.z/sql`
  # Run BASH script to setup database
    * `./loadsch.sh gnizr_db gnizr gnizrpass` 
    * syntax: `loadsch [db_name] [db_username] [db_password]`
