of http://www.cnn.com and tagged it using "news" and "cnn". To find this bookmark, in your tag cloud, click on either "cnn" or "news".

You can also go directly to bookmarks of a particular tag via URL.

    * Your bookmarks tagged "cnn": http://yoursite/user/yourusername/tag/cnn
    * Your bookmarks tagged "news": http://yoursite/user/yourusername/tag/news

You can also see bookmarks tagged by other users via URL

    * Bookmarks tagged "cnn" : http://yoursite/tag/cnn

The search syntax of Match text supports natural language text search. For example

    * java programming related to database
    * web technology on knowledge management

The search syntax of Match tags supports various logical operations. For example,

    * "+apple +juice": find bookmarks that have both tags.
