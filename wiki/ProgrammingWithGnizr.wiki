#summary Programming with gnizr Java API and how to setup a build environment
#labels Phase-Implementation

This document is intended for developers who want to write programs against gnizr Java API. 

= Introduction =

Gnizr provides a set of Java API that allows developers to create new application behavior  and to interface with gnizr data objects -- e.g., user accounts, bookmarks, links, tags and folders and RSS feeds.

There are several different ways that developers can introduce new application behavior: 
  # Create new WebWork actions or JavaScript code that augment the existing gnizr function. 
  # Create custom implementations of gnizr interface components and inject these implementations into a gnizr installation. 
  # Create Java programs to manipulate the data objects stored in the gnizr database.
  # Create web mashup programs to consume RDF, JSON or RSS documents published by gnizr.

Developing third-party web mashup programs doesn't require special build enviornment setup. These programs simply read data documents from the appropriate URL published by the gnizr web application. 

Create Java programs to access data objects stored in a gnizr database or develop custom gnizr components will require the use of *gnizr Core API*. 

Adding new application behavior by create WebWork actions will also require the use of *gnizr Core API* and *gnizr Web Application API*.
