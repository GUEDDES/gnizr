#summary Describes the design and implementation of different user registration policy.
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-Implementation

|| NOTE: This document is for gnizr 2.4 only ||

Gnizr implements a policy-driven user registration function. Depending on the configuration, system administrators can choose to implement one of the following user registration policy:

  # _Open Policy_: allow any one with a valid email address to create and activate new user accounts.
  # _Approval Policy_: allow any one to create new accounts, but their activation requires the explicit approval from the administrator.
  # _Close Policy_: prohibit any one to create new account, and only the administrator can create and activate new user accounts.

== Configuration == 

To set the user registration policy, system administrators should edit the `registrationPolicy` property in `gnizr-config.xml`. 

Valid values for `registrationPolicy`:
  * `open` -- for Open Policy
  * `close` -- for Close Policy
  * `approval` -- for Approval Policy

If this property is not defined, the default value is `open`.
