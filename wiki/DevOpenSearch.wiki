= Gnizr !OpenSearch =

Gnizr supports [http://www.opensearch.org OpenSearch] in two different ways. 

First, it provides a search engine aggregator that allows users to search over multiple !OpenSearch search services simultaneously. Search over third-party applications (e.g., Google and Wikipedia) can be made available to gnizr users by registering new !OpenSearch description files with gnizr.

Second, gnizr provides !OpenSearch for its bookmark search. Gnizr users can add 'gnizr search' as a search plugin to their Firefox browser. Developers can create new applications that query gnizr search via the !OpenSearch standard.
